                        <p>Diabetes is one of the leading disorders to plague our generation today. Yes, it's a disorder, not a disease, and the good news is that it can be well managed with proper self-care and treatment. However, this disorder can lead to a number of serious complications, whether of the heart, nerves or eyes, and if diagnosed late or left untreated, the damage can be irrevocable. It's important to partner with the right diabetes clinic, who devises the right plan to guide you and keep you healthy with the condition. </p>
                        <p><h3>What are the types of diabetes?</h3>
Diabetes is a chronic condition resulting in high blood sugar levels, because of the impaired glucose regulation in the body. 
After having food, our digestive system breakdowns the food into glucose and other nutrients that are released into blood. Insulin is a key hormone
 produced by the pancreas and responsible for glucose uptake from the blood to the cells for their functioning. Thus, glucose serves as a fuel for the human body 
 and is required for  all voluntary processes like playing, working, etc. and involuntary processes like heart functioning, digestion, blood circulation, etc. 
 Absence of insulin or decreased  sensitivity of the body cells to insulin results in diabetes.

There are three major types of diabetes, each having a different cause and management strategy as given below:

Type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes:Types of diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is an important and less prevalent type of diabetes that develops most often at a relatively younger age (children or young adults), and so also called 
juvenile diabetes. It is an auto-immune condition where the body’s own immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in pancreas, thus resulting in lack of insulin
 in the body. Management of people with type I diabetes requires lifelong insulin supplementation, controlled diet and exercise to help them maintain sugar control.

<h3>Type 2 or non-insulin dependent diabetes:</h3>
Type 2 diabetes is the highly prevalent form of diabetes that affects mostly adults or older age groups. In this specific diabetic condition, the insulin is produced 
in very low amounts and is insufficient Both hereditary and lifestyle factors such as poor eating behaviour, sedentary lifestyle, low physical activity, being overweight
 or obese, play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes.

<h3>Gestational diabetes:</h3>
A third type of diabetes, gestational diabetes, is a temporary condition that occurs usually during the second trimester of pregnancy, and disappears

<h3>Pre-diabetes</h3>
Pre-diabetes is state in which the person’s blood sugar level is higher than normal level but not high enough to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.

Pre-diabetes not only indicates a high risk of diabetes but also the onset of heart or blood vessel diseases. Many people with pre-diabetes can develop type 2 diabetes
 over a span of 10 years, however, following a balanced diet, appropriate physical activity, and maintaining healthy weight, they can delay or prevent the progression.</p>
