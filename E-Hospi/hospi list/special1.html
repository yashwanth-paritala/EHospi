                        <p>Today, Oncology signifies comprehensive care, which requires commitment, expertise and immense dedication. 
						The Oncology Team brings together the brightest minds in surgical, medical & radiation Oncology.cancer care experts, along with the latest Diagnostics 
						such as the 64 slice PET CT, the Individualized therapy profiling using molecular diagnostics and genetics, the latest in Radiation therapy such as the TrueBeam STX and the soon to be launched Proton therapy, and the skilled Robotic surgeons who perform minimally invasive surgery, offer the best chance for every patient to conquer cancer.</p>
                        <p>Proton Beam Therapy is one of the most advanced forms of radiation therapy in the world. It uses high-energy proton beam for cancer treatment.
The proton beam therapy is a form of particle therapy that will usher in a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. It provides targeted treatment and 
amplification unlike any other radiation treatment.Conventional radiotherapy uses high energy X-Rays to treat cancer and certain benign tumors. In doing so,
 it also damages the healthy tissue. Another disadvantage is the  delivery of radiation to the healthy tissue around the tumor. In contrast, proton beam delivers 
 a high dose of radiation only to the tumor maximizing the chances of cure  and in turn minimizing the adverse effects to the surrounding healthy tissues.
Furthermore a superlative advantage is its proper dose distribution. A low dose of radiation is released at the body surface which is followed by a sharp burst once
 it hits the tumor, with negligible radiation travelling beyond the target. The protons can deliver highly conformal radiation to any shape, volume or depth of the 
 tumor by controlling the delivery of their entire energy to the so-called 'Braggs Peak Region' Proton Beam Therapy has revolutionized the treatment of several
 cancers like paediatric cancers, skull base tumors, brain tumors, prostate cancers, and lung cancer to name a few. It becomes a viable option, particularly in cases
 where treatment options are limited and conventional radiotherapy possess a higher risk to patients. Proton beam therapy has to a large extent, overcome the limitations 
 of conventional radiotherapy. It has the potential to cure more cancers with better  quality of life, during and after treatment.</p>
